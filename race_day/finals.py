"""
The finals in FPVTrackside: every class's mains in the same rounds, one race
per main in turn.

    Finals 1   A W1-1 · B W1-1 · C W1-1 · Beginners A W1-1 · A W1-2 · B W1-2 …
    Finals 2   A W2-1 · B W2-1 · … (as their line-ups become known)

Each main is a Seeder stage (race_day/eventsetup.py, "Make the brackets"),
made without the Seeder's own sending: the Seeder puts a stage's races in a
round of its own, and the club flies A, B, C, D, Beginners, then A again. So
the app does the Seeder's two jobs itself:

  1. the next Finals round (only the one after the round being flown)
     appears as soon as a pilot is known for one of its races: all of its
     races at once, in turn, each with the pilots known so far (the bracket
     diagram's seats: the 3rd and 4th of W2-1 are in L2-1 the moment W2-1 is
     flown); after each race the pilots now known join their race. All at
     once because FPVTrackside keeps races in the order they're made: a race
     added to a round later would go last. Finals n holds the races of round
     n in their stages (a chase the ace's 2nd, 3rd… race go in the rounds
     after, once the Seeder says they're needed; one it no longer needs is
     deleted, unless flown). Within a round, the mains take turns: the 1st
     race of each main (classes in their order, mains A, B, C…), then the
     2nd of each…
  2. when such a race finishes in FPVTrackside, its finishing order goes to
     its stage (POST /stages/{id}/races/{race}/result), so the Seeder moves
     the pilots on; a marshal's later change in FPVTrackside is sent again
     while the Seeder still takes it.

This runs by itself after each race (race_day/eventday.py), once every class
that has pilots has its brackets made. What it made is in event_setup.json:

    made.finals.races   {"<stage id>:<stage race id>": {ext, round, fpv, class, main,
                          group, advance, title, posted}}

Each race keeps a seat per pilot on the pilot's own channel when it's free
(seat_by_channel).
