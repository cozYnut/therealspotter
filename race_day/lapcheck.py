"""
Marshal assist: a pilot's laps from the timing system (LapRF) against the
laps seen in the video.

A lap boundary in the video is where the pilot crosses the start/finish
gate. It's found from the gate sequence, not only from G1 itself (the
detector misses some passes): a G1 pass gives the exact moment; G13 → G2
with G1 not seen means the line was crossed somewhere between those two
passes. Each boundary is a time window [a, b].

Only disagreements are reported, each with a confidence:

  missed    the video shows the pilot cross the start/finish where the
            timing system has no detection: G1 seen, a whole lap (most gates)
            in a believable time, and the pilot flies on afterwards → a lap
            to add
  false     a timing detection with an impossible lap time and no
            start/finish crossing near it in the video → a lap to remove
  unsure    anything else that doesn't match: the video can't tell for
            sure (a missed or mislabelled gate, a crash at the line, a bad
            picture, a DJI feed…) — for a person to look at

Only "missed" and "false" are high confidence, and those are the only ones
Auto mode writes. On 2027Race1 every looser rule (e.g. "the video shows
the pilot mid-lap") produced wrong corrections, so the rules stay strict.
A lap is never added where FPVTrackside wouldn't count one (see rules in
check_pilot): Training 1 2027 had 31 wrong additions, all of them a second
copy of a crossing the timing already had, or a lap after the pilot's race.

Times: video passes are converted to the clock with the heat's frame times,
plus an offset (the timing antenna isn't exactly at the visual gate),
measured per heat (heat_offset). The antenna can fire anywhere from the
start/finish gate to the gate after it (Training 1 2027: up to 1.6 s after
G1), so a timing crossing from EARLY_S before to LATE_S after the video's
crossing is the same crossing.
